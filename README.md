## Dapp flow is:

1. An address challenges another address and specifies a referee address and optionally a bet amount
2. Challenged address accepts the challenge and bets the same amount as the proposer address
3. Referee sets the game as started and challenge can't be canceled no more (suposedly, this coincides with a real life sports match)
4. Referee sets the score and prize gets distributed accordingly (and then all to winner, or split if tie)
5. (still not implemented) After results are in, a SVG NFT with the results of the match in the image can be claimed by all parts involved

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Sportsbook, follow the steps below:

1. Open a terminal, clone this repo, and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/luloxi/sportsbook.git
cd sportsbook
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the Home or debug contracts in the frontend.
